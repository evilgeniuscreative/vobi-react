                    I've worked with a lot of voice actors in my career, and every job requires
                    something unique. In this case, I was searching for a Bill Nye sound-alike. I
                    combed through dozens of disappointing auditions, untilâ€¦ voila! Ian Kleinfeld.
                    He hit the mark perfectly. Then, once we got down to the actual job, Ian proved
                    that he's as professional as it gets. Very responsive, super-easy to communicate
                    with, multi-talented, and handed over perfectly professional files in a timely
                    way. And because he does so much more than a great Bill Nye impersonation, I'll
                    be going back to work with him on other jobs.

                    Ian voiced and edited a 7,500 word online informercial for us in just a few
                    days, so that I didn't have to. With a little practice, His impression of me was
                    so good that I could have it done and take care of more important business
                    issues than reading a script. He was very professional and easy to work with and
                    direct and I would definitely recommend him to anyone needing a voiceover. 5
                    stars!

                    Ian quickly and professionally recorded a voiceover for a video we were
                    producing. He was able to capture the tone and style we were looking for
                    perfectly. His turnaround time was very quick, and the quality of the recording
                    was top-notch. We will definitely be using his services again in the future.
